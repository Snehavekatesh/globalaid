      <div class="col-lg-12"> <h3> Hemavathi</h3><p> Hemavathi is a girl with one hand disability due to a construction site accident. She is the daughter of a construction labor couple. Hema is an ambitious girl who excelled in studies. Sensing her talent, we gave seat to her in our residential hostel under Hub n Spoke Project. Our dedicated and committed staff coached Hema about life values and determination to pursue her dreams. Hema represented State of Andhra Pradesh in javelin throw game with her one hand. Her hard work paid off. Hema got seat in rural IIIT where 6 years of her education is completely free of cost and sponsored by government. Hema is pursuing third year of her course. She takes great pride in mentoring next batches of kids in our hostel too. She is a great role model now.
