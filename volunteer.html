</h3> <p>I have been associated with Sai and Anand since last one year and It has been an inspiring relationship.
    Their dedication towards their work is commendable and what I liked especially was their approach towards educating the tribal kids on different issues who in turn try to educate their parents on basic issues related to health, cleanliness and other related issues and this is the best way to bring about change in the mindset and eradicate problems.
    I am happy to be associated with Global Aid and very happy to see them bringing change among the underprivileged. In a way it has inspired my kids too, they contributed towards this charity from their pocket money and are eager to be a part of any charity</p></div>

<div class="item" data-aos="fade-up-right"><h3> Mr. Gopichand Maruri, IT Professional, TCS:
</h3> <p>To be associated with Global Aid gives me happiness. While the organization takes up a lot of activities, I volunteered for most of them. It is an honor to witness and be a part of making the world a better place along with Sai Padma Garu and Pragnanand Garu.While we continue to do so, what catches my soul is the activities with kids from the tribal hamlets. Making 100 kids feel happy is not easy. It must be written as a lesson in the textbook. While we witness life through smartphones and laptops, they are being taught to witness the life through nature with a little technology as help in their hands. With a positive approach towards future endeavors, here is a moment I captured during one of my wonderful volunteering experiences. Their smiles!

<div class="item" data-aos="fade-up-left"><h3> Mrs. Ruth James , Special Educator and Special Mother:</h3> <p> It has been a privilege to work with Global Aid as a volunteer for the last 5 years. During these five years, I have been given an opportunity to serve in various fields. I have been instrumental in supporting medication for a special child who was found abandoned along the road. I was a guest speaker as a parent care giver at the Autism workshop, conducted at the IIAM, Vizag. I could volunteer to help at the HSBC SevaMela, along with other fellow volunteers. Since youth and empowering women is a passion with me, along with a few friends we were instrumental in designing fashion ware that subsequently went on for sale at a Christmas Mela. Pep talks with young girls from the rural hostel, a talk on body language and how to conduct oneself was taken with a group of nursing students from Care Nursing School, counselling and mentoring support for parents with special children and providing support to disabled sports women, by escorting them on their trip to Hyderabad, are some of the ways I have been able to lend my support to Global Aid in the last few years!

<div class="item" data-aos="fade-up-right"><h3>Mr. ManikantaSaluru, Multi Media Professional & Documentary Film Maker :
</h3> <p> I’m a Multimedia Artist and I’ve been associated with many NGO’s and learnt new things about social work. I always believe that education is the primary source of differentiating good from bad, and that can be achieved through activity based learning, logical thinking and reasoning. When I first went to video document their operations, to my surprise I found that Global Aid was implementing the same from many years and this made me feel like, I’m home. The association with Global Aid made me realize that understanding the needs is more important than just learning new things. The way the organization management treats the others is truly appreciable. They welcome everyone with open arms. This organization have a well-planned structure that makes sure that everything implemented reaches to the beneficiaries who are in need.The dynamic duo Mr. Pragnanand and Mrs. Sai Padma of Global Aid have a clear vision about their organization. My association with Global Aid was around 3years (till date) and I’m looking forward for many more years.</p></div>
<div class="item" data-aos="fade-up-left"><h3>  Jayathi Lohithakshan, Freelance Photo Documentation Specialist, Educational Activist :
</h3> <p> It was a great and the most memorable event that I always cherish whenever I remember the children of the hostel. Though I spent less than a week with them what made me to remember them was their inherent innocence and peace with the environment of their living, which of course, was very impressive. In fact, that made me to think how man and nature indispensable to each other. The hostel life made them on other hand, to understand each other and survive in different situations. Ultimately, it also helps them to dream and materialize their educational aspirations. What worries me still, that our so called mainstream education system not at all inclusive or effective in taking into consideration of tribal children's cultural identities and their own way of understanding of nature which is based on wisdom rather than knowledge.</p></div>
<div class="item" data-aos="fade-up-right"><h3> Aruna Gali, Co-founder , Vikasadhatri Web Portal:
</h3> <p> I have had a great opportunity to meet and interact with children living in Hub and Spoke Hostel of Global Aid on 2 January 2016, at Visakhapatnam. All the children enjoyed at the Sai Priya resorts beach, sponsored by Prof. Sameer Prasad. Children were seen playing beach volley ball, bathing in the sea water, and encouraging me to click photos and videos with their friends and forming their own small groups. All the children irrespective of their age, interacted and expressed themselves without any shy with a new person like me. It was a happy moment to be there and spend with children as a Global Aid Volunteer from VikasaDhatri</p></div>
