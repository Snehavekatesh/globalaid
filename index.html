			<p>HUB N SPOKE is a flagship project of Global AID which caters to the educational needs of the children in a rural belt located in the Andra Mandal of Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh. This year a total 169 children in the hamlets (spoke) and 51 children in the hostel (hub) benefitted from the program.
				People who live in these hamlets are migrant laborers who migrated from the neighboring states of Bihar, Orissa, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Development and Modernization are aliens to their land. Their means of livelihood is agriculture and quarry work and their earnings are meagre. In this backdrop, Hub N Spoke emerged like a lotus in the pond for the children of agricultural laborers.
				Global AID appoints teachers in these hamlets who work towards increasing the attendance rate of children to schools as well as facilitating language skills. </p>
			<p>Teaching is imparted to children through activity based learning. With the support of trained teachers, academic coordinators and retired teachers Global Aid is focusing on creating opportunities of Learning through Fun. They believe that this helps in the holistic development of a child.
			Children who get used to activity based learning in these hamlets (Spokes) eventually join the hostel (Hub) located in Gajapatinagaram. These children get enrolled into Government schools.
			Global Aid hostel, consisting of 75 students provides accommodation and food to all the children. Apart from this, hostel gives special care and education, training in extracurricular activities to the children who are offshoot from the spokes.
			</p>
			<p>Hub N Spoke is a brainchild of Prof. Sameer Prasad, a supply chain management professional, and Sai Padma and Pragnanand, a noble couple who work for the benefit of under privileged.
			The Hub Hostel is funded by IDS (India Development Services) a non-profit organization which is dedicated to support economic and social development in India. IDS serves in remote, under-developed and difficult areas that are in need. In addition, the hostel is managed by Lions Trust, Annapoorna Foundation, USA and Global Aid.
			HUB n SPOKE is exploring new avenues to provide additional services to the community by extending support to more hamlet schools, creating Vocational schools, increasing hostel capacity and health care network to add value to educational stream.
			Be a part of this journey to see smiles on the faces of our children.
			All of us smile in one language and that is the language of Happiness and Bliss.</p>

			<p> Healthy populations are essential for the advancement of human development, well-being and to accelerate growth. Being healthy and having access to quality & effective health care services is significantly important for all populations, irrespective of gender, age, socio-cultural-economic status or where one lives.
			</p>
			<p>The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, greatly impact health of the communities. This entails maximum exposures to factors like building/improving health, building resilience thus reduces vulnerability to health risks, and protecting people from the consequences of illness thus enabling to prevent burden of expenditures when ill. On the other side, productivity gets negatively impacted when time is spent treating disease.
			</p>
			<p>and an intergenerational effect through lower birth weight. Damage suffered in early life may lead to impairments and affect future generations. Hence, health is crucial to individual, family, community and country. Access to balanced diet inclusive of natural and nutritious foods becomes a basic component of health.
				Tribal communities have been practicing rainfed farming, growing crops that posses high nutritive values requiring little amount of moisture. But this got affected with a drastic fall in demand for these crops.  Rainfed agriculture in the tribal belt of the state is very much vulnerable to the impacts of natural calamities.
			</p>
			<p> Furthermore, scheduled tribes have very poor sanitation and health care practices – defecating outdoors and use of witch doctors is still common. Such poor practices lead to diseases (communicable & non- communicable).
				The basis for a good health is consumption of balanced and nutritive food, intake of clean water and air. The basic condition for hygiene and clean environment is good practices by the community.
				Global AID focuses on long term programs focused on nurturing remote tribal and rural communities in enhancing the skills in rainfed farming and creating preventive health care and support systems through health and hygiene education.

			<h5> Accessibility - A way of life..!!
			</h5>
			<p>Accessibility is not an issue which is confined to only old and physically disabled individuals. It is a universal issue. Imagine yourself in a situation where you cannot climb stairs due to your back pain or access a public place due to its placement or stranded in a desert or woods searching for the destination, caught in deep waters trying to find out the shore. A deep pain of helplessness envelopes. This is the most terrifying condition where one feels helpless and turns towards the sky folding their hands in prayer for rescue. Every living being on this earth has a right to live, right to access no matter whoever they are.

			</p>
			<p> Accessibility is living a full life, lack of access is like having double disability. Many public places in our country are not accessible to many old and disabled sections of the society. The local governments should conduct their respective area access audits and make the place safe and sound for all. Local communities and DPOs should take help of local clubs and communities and such type of organizations in assessing and implementing access. The role of senior citizen organizations is crucial to raise awareness. Malls and other public places should have access advocacy group of volunteers with right kind of signboards and placards. Accessible transport system by even private agencies will help gain more visibility. Access at service places like hospitals and nursing departments and giving wide coverage to the establishments will ensure enhanced visibility. Youth and social service organizations can work towards the endeavor of turning public places to accessible destinations to go around and spend some time over there. <br>Global AID is working towards creating an accessible society through its focus on the areas such as:
			</p>
			<p>

				1)Identification of places where accessibility is an issue and conduct access audits and bring attention of relevant authorities to turn them into places of accessibility.<br>
				2)Gathering local support and document every effort & teach universal design standards to everyone, especially those in civil construction field.<br>
				3)Making access information truly accessible to everyone and making accessible India campaign a success.<br>
				4)Ensuring provision of reserved parking places for vehicles.<br>
				5)Ensuring provision of ramps/wheelchairs in shopping malls.<br>
				6)Provision of home based physiotherapy services.<br>
				 </p>
			<h5> Mobility</h5>

			<p> Mobility plays a prime role in the lives of people, be it moving around in a home or commute to daily work to earn living. Life comes to a halt without mobility and this is much needed task to cope with the needs of Life. <br>In order to help physically challenged people Global AID is working in the fields of mobility through: </p>
			<p> 1)Distribution of wheel chairs, hearing aids, calipers and other assistive devices through networking with individuals and institutions<br>

				3)Guiding and providing information related to various assistive devices.<br>
				4)Support in medical assessment of PwDs.<br>
				5)Post surgical rehabilitation & counseling and psycho social support.<br>
				6)Car modification information and guidance to PwDs.<br>
				</p>
				<h5> Employability</h5>
			<p> Employment creates livelihood and creates an opportunity to earn income. Employment enables one to lead a life filled with dignity and respect. A nation’s economic development is measured by the quality of life and employment opportunities that the country provides to its citizens.<br> Global AID is working in this area through:
			</p>
